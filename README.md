# Credit-Risk

## Overview
This document serves as an overview of the Credit Risk Analysis project, which aims to evaluate the risk associated with lending to individuals. The project employs various statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their loans.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into multiple sections, each detailing a specific aspect of the credit risk analysis process:

- Data Collection: A description of the dataset used, including the source and characteristics of the data.
- Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis, such as handling missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
- Feature Engineering: Techniques used to create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Model Selection: Criteria and methods used to select the appropriate machine learning model for the prediction task.
- Model Evaluation: The approach taken to assess the performance of the model, including validation strategies and performance metrics.
- Findings and Recommendations: Conclusions drawn from the analysis and recommendations for stakeholders based on the predictive model's results.
  
## Key Features

- Detailed documentation of the methods and algorithms used throughout the project.
- Insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, highlighting key factors influencing credit risk.
- A transparent evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy and limitations.
- Visualizations that elucidate complex relationships within the data.
